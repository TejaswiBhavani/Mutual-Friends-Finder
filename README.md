# Mutual-Friends-Finder
A Python script that finds mutual friends between a specified person and others in a social network. The network is represented as a dictionary of friends, where each key is a person’s name and the value is a set of friends. The program allows users to input a friend’s name and returns their mutual friends with other people in the network, if any.
